# Project Summary
Sentiment Analysis project using R programming.


I used the ‘janeaustenR’ dataset that we will use will be provided by the R package. I performed text analysis on the data using Tidytext. Next, I used the “bing” lexicon to and implement filter() over the words that correspond to joy. Next, I used functions such as filter(), spread(), mutate() to find correspondence, segregate and calculate total sentiment.
For visualization, I created a plot showing sentiment score and wordcloud to delineate the most recurring positive and negative words.

# Overview: 
Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

# Application to Business: 
The application of sentiment analysis in a business environment is analysis of customer feedback. Based on the included words and the associated sentiment in the feedback, the analysis assigns a sentiment score to them. As a result, positive feedback gets a higher sentiment score while negative feedback gathers a lower score.
